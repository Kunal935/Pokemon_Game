It uses fuzzy matching to find the closest matching Pokémon names and fetches animated GIFs from Tenor API to enhance the user experience. The dataset used is a CSV file containing Pokémon statistics such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Generation, and Legendary status.
